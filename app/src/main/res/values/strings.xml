        \t<i><b>VASIR</b></i> is an application that utilizes visual analog scales for subjective speech intelligibility rating.\n
        \tIf you\'re already familiar with this application, feel free to continue below and start rating.
        To find out more info about how to use this app, scroll down in this panel.

    <string name="welcome_message_further_info">
        \tAfter proceeding, the app will ask you to select a directory containing the audio files of speech recordings to be rated.
        The location of the files is arbitrary, but we <i>recommend</i> saving them to a standard directory
        on your phone\'s internal storage (e.g. the <i>Documents</i> folder).\n\n
        \tAfterwards, the app performs a randomization on the found audio files and prepares them for rating. You can browse through
        the available files using the build-in player, listen to their contents through headphones,
        and finally, rate them on the continuous analog scale located to the bottom of the rating screen.
        When all available files have been rated, a double checkmark icon will appear.
        The current session is saved automatically on app exit, but can be also saved manually using the dropdown menu in the top-right corner.
        This menu also allows you to see the saved recordings and share them via Cloud, email, etc.

        This application was developed for use in research and development in the department of circuit theory, faculty of electrotechnics, CTU in Prague.\n

        This app is used for easy subjective scoring of speech recording intelligibility by listeners.
        Precise use of the application depends on the experiment being conducted, but the general
        aim of the application was to subjectively rate speech deterioration in patients suffering
        from neurodegenerative diseases.\n\n
        Assuming you have correctly placed the speech recording files into the specified folder on the
        phone\'s SD card (as is described in the dialog shown in case the application was not able
        to find any data), using the app is fairly simple.\n\n
        The application automatically randomizes the loaded recordings during the creation of a new
        rating session (resetting the current session). The recordings are then played using the
        provided application interface. Listener uses the \"play\" and \"pause\" buttons and the seek bar
        to listen to the recordings, changing between them using the \"next\" and \"previous\" buttons.
        Total recording count as well as the number of the current recording is displayed in the
        header.\n\n
        Recordings are rated using the Visual Analog Scale in the lower part of the screen. User simply
        places the seek button on the desired position on the track, which represents the subjectively
        perceived speech intelligibility of the speaker\'s voice, in range from \"completely
        unintelligible\" (no words comprehended) to \"perfectly intelligible\" (TV reporter level).
        The number of ratings and backward editing of the ratings are not restricted, nevertheless
        users should be instructed to listen to the recordings twice in maximum. After a recording
        is successfully rated, a green checkmark sign will appear.\n\n
        A double green checkmark sign will show up after all the provided recordings have been rated,
        along with a brief message. The ratings will be automatically saved to the application folder
        on the phone\'s memory card while the application is closed. The rating progress in the scope
        of one rating session is also automatically preserved in the case of closing or exiting the app,
        right until a new session is requested by the user, or up to the occasion of a reinstall.\n\n
